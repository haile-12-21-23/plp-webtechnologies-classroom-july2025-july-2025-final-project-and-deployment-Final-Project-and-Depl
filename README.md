# Multipage Portfolio Website

This is a multipage portfolio website built using **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**.
It showcases my skills, projects, and contact information, with a responsive design and interactive elements.

## Step 1: Planning & Organizing
Before development, the website was carefully planned:

- **Purpose:** Portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and contact details.
- **Pages:**
  1. Home
  2. About
  3. Projects
  4. Contact
- **Navigation:** A consistent navbar links all pages.
- **Layout:** Each page has a header, main content section, and footer.
- **Sketch/Layout:** Planned sections with headings, content blocks, buttons, and forms for interactivity.

## Step 2: Building the Website
The website was developed with the following:

- **HTML5:** Semantic structure using `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`.
- **CSS3:**
  - Responsive design using Flexbox and Grid.
  - CSS transitions and keyframe animations for hover effects and page elements.
- **JavaScript:**
  - Mobile menu toggle for smaller screens.
  - Contact form validation with success/error messages.
  - Optional interactive animations (scroll-based, button-triggered).
